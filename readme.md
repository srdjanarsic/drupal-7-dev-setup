# Drupal

This is my personal reminder about drupal development.

* [Prepare development environment](prepare-dev.md)
* [Module development](module-dev.md)

How to use custom ajax in Drulap 7 (to register routes and handle get/post request on the drupal side, as well as to set jQuery requests) is described in [drupal-7-js-and-ajax](https://github.com/srdjanarsic/drupal-7-js-and-ajax).
